# Getting Started with AWS

Amazon Web Services (**AWS**) is a comprehensive cloud platform that offers over 200 fully featured services for compute, storage, databases, machine learning, and more. AWS enables businesses to scale efficiently and securely.

## Why Choose AWS?

1. **Scalability**: Scale your applications seamlessly with resources like EC2 and S3.
2. **Global Infrastructure**: Deploy services across multiple regions and availability zones.
3. **Security**: Industry-leading security, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption.
4. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**: Only pay for what you use.

## Core Concepts in AWS

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Security is a top priority in AWS. MFA adds an extra layer of protection to your account.

- **Setup MFA**:
  1. Go to the **IAM Console**.
  2. Select your user and click "Security Credentials."
  3. Add an MFA device (e.g., Authenticator App or hardware token).

This ensures that even if your credentials are compromised, unauthorized access is prevented.

### AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)
The **AWS CLI** allows you to manage AWS services programmatically. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Install the CLI**:
   - Download from the [official website](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).
2. **Configure the CLI**:
   
bash
   aws configure
