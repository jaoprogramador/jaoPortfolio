## What are HTTP Status Codes? üöÄ
HTTP status codes are standard responses sent by servers to requests made by clients (browsers or APIs). These codes indicate whether a request was successful, if there were redirects, or if errors occurred. ‚ú®

## Why are HTTP Status Codes Important?
They help with debugging: Quickly identify errors in web development.

They improve user experience: A well-configured site responds appropriately to each request.

SEO optimization: Search engines value proper handling of redirects and errors.

Efficient communication: They allow clients and servers to exchange information in a structured way.

## Categories of HTTP Status Codes

1xx - Informational Responses
These are provisional responses indicating that the request is being processed.

**100** Continue: The server has received the request, and the client can continue sending the body of the request.

**101** Switching Protocols: The server agrees to switch to a different requested protocol.

## 2xx - Successful Responses ‚úÖ
These indicate that the request was received, understood, and processed successfully.

**200** OK: The request has been completed successfully.

**201** Created: A new resource has been successfully created.

**204** No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.

## 3xx - Redirections üîÑ
These indicate that the client must take further action to complete the request.

**301** Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to another URL.

**302** Found: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.

**304** Not Modified: Indicates that the resource has not changed and the cached version can be used.

## 4xx - Client Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è
These errors occur when the request has an issue on the client side.

**400** Bad Request: The request is incorrect or malformed.

**401** Unauthorized: Authentication is required to access the resource.

**403** Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the resource.

**404** Not Found: The requested resource was not found.

## 5xx - Server Errors ‚ùå
These occur when there are issues on the server side while processing the request.

**500** Internal Server Error: A generic server error prevents the request from being completed.

**502** Bad Gateway: A server received an invalid response from another server.

**503** Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unavailable.

## Conclusion üèÅ
Understanding HTTP status codes will help improve the quality and performance of your web applications. Quickly identifying errors and properly handling redirects and responses will improve both user experience and search engine ranking. üöÄ
