# Getting Started with React

**React** is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook and a community of developers. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of complex applications efficiently.

## Core Concepts of React

React focuses on three primary concepts:

1. **Components**: Building blocks of a React application.
2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.
3. **State and Props**: Mechanisms for managing data and passing it between components.

### Understanding Components

A React component can be a class or a function. For instance, here is a simple functional component:

```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

export default Greeting;
```
