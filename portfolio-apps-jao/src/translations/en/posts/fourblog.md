## Why Choose Spring?

1. **Ease of Use**: Spring Boot simplifies application setup with minimal configuration.
2. **Powerful Integration**: Supports PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and many other data stores.
3. **Security First**: Advanced security features like JWT, OAuth2, and more.
4. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Tools like Swagger make APIs easy to explore.
5. **Enterprise-Grade**: Ideal for scalable, secure, and high-performance applications.

## Spring Modules Overview

### Spring Boot
Spring Boot reduces boilerplate code and lets you focus on business logic by providing default configurations. Example of a simple REST controller:

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class UserController {

    @GetMapping("/users")
    public List<String> getAllUsers() {
        return List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
    }
}
