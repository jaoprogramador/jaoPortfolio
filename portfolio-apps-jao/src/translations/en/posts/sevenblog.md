# What Are Hooks in React?
Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components without needing to write a class. Introduced in React 16.8, they simplify logic and improve code reuse.

## Why Use Hooks in React?
Ease of use: They allow you to manage state without needing classes.
Cleaner code: They eliminate the complexity of lifecycle methods.
Reusability: They make it easier to extract logic into reusable functions.
Better performance: They reduce unnecessary re-renders.
Main Hooks in React
## useState
The useState hook allows you to manage state inside functional components.

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";  

function Counter() {  
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);  

  return (  
    <div>  
      <p>Counter: {counter}</p>  
      <button onClick={() => setCounter(counter + 1)}>Increment</button>  
    </div>  
  );  
} 
``` 
## useEffect
useEffect handles side effects such as API calls or DOM manipulation.

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";  

function UserData() {  
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);  

  useEffect(() => {  
    fetch("https://api.example.com/user")  
      .then(response => response.json())  
      .then(data => setUser(data));  
  }, []);  

  return <div>{user ? <p>Name: {user.name}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}</div>;  
}  
  ```
## useRef
useRef is used to access DOM elements or store persistent values without causing re-renders.

```jsx
import { useRef } from "react";  

function FocusedInput() {  
  const inputRef = useRef(null);  

  const focus = () => {  
    inputRef.current.focus();  
  };  

  return (  
    <div>  
      <input ref={inputRef} type="text" />  
      <button onClick={focus}>Focus Input</button>  
    </div>  
  );  
}  
```
## useContext
useContext allows you to access values from a context without needing prop drilling.

```jsx
import { useContext } from "react";  
const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");  

function Component() {  
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);  
  return <p>The current theme is {theme}</p>;  
}  
  ```
## useMemo
useMemo memoizes computed values to avoid unnecessary calculations on each render.

```jsx
import { useState, useMemo } from "react";  

function HeavyCalculation({ number }) {  
  const result = useMemo(() => {  
    console.log("Calculating...");  
    return number * 2;  
  }, [number]);  

  return <p>Result: {result}</p>;  
}  
```
## Conclusion
Hooks in React have revolutionized how we manage state and effects in functional components. Knowing and using the most important ones will help you write cleaner and more efficient code.
