# What are SOLID Principles?
SOLID principles are a set of good software design practices proposed by Robert C. Martin. Their goal is to improve the quality, maintainability, and scalability of the code.

## Why use SOLID principles?
Cleaner and more organized code.
Facilitates reuse and maintenance.
Improves scalability and flexibility of software.
Reduces coupling between components.
## The SOLID Principles
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Each class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.
```jsx

class Report {  
  generatePDF() {  
    // Logic to generate PDF  
  }  
}  
To comply with SRP, we separate the responsibilities:

```jsx
class Report {  
  getData() {  
    // Get report data  
  }  
}  

class PDFExporter {  
  export(report) {  
    // Generate PDF with the data  
  }  
}  
## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

```jsx
class AreaCalculator {  
  calculate(shape) {  
    return shape.area();  
  }  
}  
Each new shape only needs to implement an area() method without modifying the AreaCalculator.

## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Derived classes should be able to substitute their base classes without altering the expected behavior.

```jsx
class Bird {  
  fly() {  
    return "Flying";  
  }  
}  

class Penguin extends Bird {  
  fly() {  
    throw new Error("Penguins cannot fly");  
  }  
}  
  ```
This code breaks LSP because Penguin cannot replace Bird. A better solution is to use composition instead of inheritance.

## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Interfaces should be specific to each need rather than being generic and forcing unnecessary method implementations.

```jsx
class Worker {  
  work() {}  
  eat() {}  
}  
```
Instead, we split it into more specific interfaces:

```jsx
class IWorker {  
  work() {}  
}  

class IEater {  
  eat() {}  
}  
  ```
## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but on abstractions.

```jsx
class MySQLDatabase {  
  connect() {  
    return "Connecting to MySQL";  
  }  
}  

class Application {  
  constructor() {  
    this.db = new MySQLDatabase();  
  }  
}  
```
This code breaks DIP because the Application depends directly on MySQLDatabase. Instead, we use an abstraction:

```jsx
class Database {  
  connect() {}  
}  

class MySQLDatabase extends Database {  
  connect() {  
    return "Connecting to MySQL";  
  }  
}  

class Application {  
  constructor(db) {  
    this.db = db;  
  }  
}  
  ```
## Conclusion
The SOLID principles help write more structured, maintainable, and scalable code. Applying them correctly will improve the quality of your projects and facilitate teamwork
