# Getting Started with Angular

**Angular** is a TypeScript-based open-source framework for building web applications, maintained by Google. Its robust ecosystem and powerful tools make it ideal for developing large-scale applications.

## Core Concepts of Angular

Angular revolves around these main concepts:

1. **Components**: The building blocks of an Angular application.
2. **Modules**: A way to organize the application into cohesive blocks.
3. **Services**: Used to manage data and logic shared across components.
4. **Directives**: Extend HTML with custom behaviors.

### Building Your First Component

Angular components are defined using the `@Component` decorator. Hereâ€™s an example of a simple Angular component:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-greeting',
  template: `<h1>Hello, {{ name }}!</h1>`,
  styles: [`h1 { font-family: Lato; }`]
})
export class GreetingComponent {
  name = 'Angular';
}
```
