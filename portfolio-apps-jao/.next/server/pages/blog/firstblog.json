It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of complex applications efficiently.\n\n## Core Concepts of React\n\nReact focuses on three primary concepts:\n\n1. **Components**: Building blocks of a React application.\n2. **JSX (JavaScript XML)**: A syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.\n3. **State and Props**: Mechanisms for managing data and passing it between components.\n\n### Understanding Components\n\nA React component can be a class or a function.
