Martin. Their goal is to improve the quality, maintainability, and scalability of the code.\r\n\r\n## Why use SOLID principles?\r\nCleaner and more organized code.\r\nFacilitates reuse and maintenance.\r\nImproves scalability and flexibility of software.\r\nReduces coupling between components.\r\n## The SOLID Principles\r\nSingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)\r\nEach class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have a single responsibility.\r\n```jsx\r\n\r\nclass Report {  \r\n  generatePDF() {  \r\n    // Logic to generate PDF  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\nTo comply with SRP, we separate the responsibilities:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass Report {  \r\n  getData() {  \r\n    // Get report data  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nclass PDFExporter {  \r\n  export(report) {  \r\n    // Generate PDF with the data  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n## 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)\r\nClasses should be open for extension but closed for modification.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass AreaCalculator {  \r\n  calculate(shape) {  \r\n    return shape.area();  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\nEach new shape only needs to implement an area() method without modifying the AreaCalculator.\r\n\r\n## 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)\r\nDerived classes should be able to substitute their base classes without altering the expected behavior.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass Bird {  \r\n  fly() {  \r\n    return \"Flying\";  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nclass Penguin extends Bird {  \r\n  fly() {  \r\n    throw new Error(\"Penguins cannot fly\");  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n  ```\r\nThis code breaks LSP because Penguin cannot replace Bird. A better solution is to use composition instead of inheritance.\r\n\r\n## 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)\r\nInterfaces should be specific to each need rather than being generic and forcing unnecessary method implementations.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass Worker {  \r\n  work() {}  \r\n  eat() {}  \r\n}  \r\n```\r\nInstead, we split it into more specific interfaces:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass IWorker {  \r\n  work() {}  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nclass IEater {  \r\n  eat() {}  \r\n}  \r\n  ```\r\n## 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)\r\nHigh-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but on abstractions.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass MySQLDatabase {  \r\n  connect() {  \r\n    return \"Connecting to MySQL\";  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nclass Application {  \r\n  constructor() {  \r\n    this.db = new MySQLDatabase();  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n```\r\nThis code breaks DIP because the Application depends directly on MySQLDatabase. Instead, we use an abstraction:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nclass Database {  \r\n  connect() {}  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nclass MySQLDatabase extends Database {  \r\n  connect() {  \r\n    return \"Connecting to MySQL\";  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n\r\nclass Application {  \r\n  constructor(db) {  \r\n    this.db = db;  \r\n  }  \r\n}  \r\n  ```\r\n## Conclusion\r\nThe SOLID principles help write more structured, maintainable, and scalable code. Applying them correctly will improve the quality of your projects and facilitate teamwork"}},"__N_SSG":true}
