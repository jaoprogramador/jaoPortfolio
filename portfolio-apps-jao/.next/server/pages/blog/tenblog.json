These codes indicate whether a request was successful, if there were redirects, or if errors occurred. ‚ú®\r\n\r\n## Why are HTTP Status Codes Important?\r\nThey help with debugging: Quickly identify errors in web development.\r\n\r\nThey improve user experience: A well-configured site responds appropriately to each request.\r\n\r\nSEO optimization: Search engines value proper handling of redirects and errors.\r\n\r\nEfficient communication: They allow clients and servers to exchange information in a structured way.\r\n\r\n## Categories of HTTP Status Codes\r\n\r\n1xx - Informational Responses\r\nThese are provisional responses indicating that the request is being processed.\r\n\r\n**100** Continue: The server has received the request, and the client can continue sending the body of the request.\r\n\r\n**101** Switching Protocols: The server agrees to switch to a different requested protocol.\r\n\r\n## 2xx - Successful Responses ‚úÖ\r\nThese indicate that the request was received, understood, and processed successfully.\r\n\r\n**200** OK: The request has been completed successfully.\r\n\r\n**201** Created: A new resource has been successfully created.\r\n\r\n**204** No Content: The request was successful, but there is no content to return.\r\n\r\n## 3xx - Redirections üîÑ\r\nThese indicate that the client must take further action to complete the request.\r\n\r\n**301** Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to another URL.\r\n\r\n**302** Found: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL.\r\n\r\n**304** Not Modified: Indicates that the resource has not changed and the cached version can be used.\r\n\r\n## 4xx - Client Errors ‚ö†Ô∏è\r\nThese errors occur when the request has an issue on the client side.\r\n\r\n**400** Bad Request: The request is incorrect or malformed.\r\n\r\n**401** Unauthorized: Authentication is required to access the resource.\r\n\r\n**403** Forbidden: The client does not have permission to access the resource.\r\n\r\n**404** Not Found: The requested resource was not found.\r\n\r\n## 5xx - Server Errors ‚ùå\r\nThese occur when there are issues on the server side while processing the request.\r\n\r\n**500** Internal Server Error: A generic server error prevents the request from being completed.\r\n\r\n**502** Bad Gateway: A server received an invalid response from another server.\r\n\r\n**503** Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unavailable.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion üèÅ\r\nUnderstanding HTTP status codes will help improve the quality and performance of your web applications. Quickly identifying errors and properly handling redirects and responses will improve both user experience and search engine ranking. üöÄ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
