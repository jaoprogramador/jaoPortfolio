AWS enables businesses to scale efficiently and securely.\r\n\r\n## Why Choose AWS?\r\n\r\n1. **Scalability**: Scale your applications seamlessly with resources like EC2 and S3.\r\n2. **Global Infrastructure**: Deploy services across multiple regions and availability zones.\r\n3. **Security**: Industry-leading security, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encryption.\r\n4. **Pay-as-You-Go Pricing**: Only pay for what you use.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Core Concepts in AWS\r\n\r\n### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)\r\nSecurity is a top priority in AWS. MFA adds an extra layer of protection to your account.\r\n\r\n- **Setup MFA**:\r\n  1. Go to the **IAM Console**.\r\n  2. Select your user and click \"Security Credentials.\"\r\n  3. Add an MFA device (e.g., Authenticator App or hardware token).\r\n\r\nThis ensures that even if your credentials are compromised, unauthorized access is prevented.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)\r\nThe **AWS CLI** allows you to manage AWS services programmatically. Here's how to set it up:\r\n\r\n1. **Install the CLI**:\r\n   - Download from the [official website](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).\r\n2. **Configure the CLI**:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   aws configure\r\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
